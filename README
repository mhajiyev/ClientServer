Simple program to simulate client/server interaction.


1.Client initiates a UDP connection with the server and handshakes using request code that is passed into the server as an argument.
2.After authorizing the user, server creates a TCP socket and send its port number via UDP connection back to the client.
3.Client receives the port number and sends a message to the server using TCP.
4.Server reverses the message and sends it back to the Client. The client receives the inverted message.
